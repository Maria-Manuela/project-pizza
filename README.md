This is my first play with JavaScript and itÂ´s an easy command for food ordering.

## The problem

I had some issue with the age integration part as I wanted to be connected with the zise and the final outcome, to have a pizza size based on the age.
But after a coding sesion with Antonella, I had an idea how to do it.
However, I did had some challenges with defining different options, and give an attribute correctly.
I did use chat GPT for helping me by naming variables properly and for a better structure.
